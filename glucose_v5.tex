TO BE REVISED\\
 We investigated experimentally and computationally the viscous spreading of a sessile drop on an identical layer.
 A practical application of this process is spray coating during which subsequent drops spread on an existing layer of the same fluid.
 We performed spreading experiments on a uniform layer as well as on a dry substrate and characterised the driving forces in both cases.
 In the case of spreading on a layer the flow is governed by viscous forces, whereas the spreading on a dry substrate is governed by surface tension.
 We then performed computational simulations of the drop spreading on an identical layer using the finite element method (FEM), as implemented in \texttt{oomph-lib}.
 These computations showed excellent agreement with the experiments.
 Through further computations we established distinct spreading regimes depending on the thickness of the layer.
 For very thick fluid layers the drop primarily sinks into the layer instead of spreading radially.
 On the other hand, for very thin layers the drop spreads similarly to a drop on dry substrate, where the spreading is governed by gravity.
 For intermediate layer thicknesses the drop spreads through an advancing wedge which is sustained by fluid flow from the drop into the layer.

\noindent TO BE WRITTEN\\
The spreading of liquids on solid substrates has received a lot of attention among the research community \cite{de1985wetting, bonn2009wetting}.
Another area of interest is the spreading of a liquid on top of another (immiscible) liquid \cite{fraaije1989dynamics, joos1977spreading}.
While these two configurations of droplet spreading are well investigated, limited research has been performed in the spreading of a sessile Newtonian drop on a layer of the same fluid \cite{tanner1979spreading, cormier2012beyond, chebbi1999capillary}.
Here we investigate the spreading of a Newtonian glucose syrup on a thick layer of the same fluid and find that in this case the flow is governed by a competition of viscous and gravitational forces.
Moreover, we show that for the spreading on a solid substrate the well established spreading law of $R \propto t^{1/10}$ is obtained, which describes flow which is governed by a competition of surface tension and gravity \cite{bonn2009wetting}.

\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}

\subsubsection{Experimental setup}
\label{setup}

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{figures/experimental_apparatus.eps}
\caption{Schematic side-view diagram of the experimental apparatus.}
\label{fig:experimental_apparatus}
\end{figure}

A schematic diagram of the side-view of the experimental apparatus is shown in figure \ref{fig:experimental_apparatus}.
The substrate was supported on a Perspex base plate, which was adjustably mounted on three vertical, threaded poles using nuts, thus allowing accurate levelling to {\bf $\pm ?^\circ$ (give accuracy, what is the pitch of the threads?)}. {\bf Also, change removable platform to removable substrate in the figure.} The setup was designed to enable the easy removal of the substrate, which was secured to the base plate with three finger-tight nylon screws. The substrate was a Perspex plate of dimensions {\bf $? \times ? \times ?$} {\bf( milled?, how flat?)}. A featureless, flat substrate was used for the dry spreading experiments, whereas for spreading on a viscous layer, a centred, circular trough with a diameter of 60.5 mm and depth of 2 {\bf $\pm ?$} mm was milled into the plate. 
The fluid was deposited using a standard 10 ml plastic syringe with a nozzle of outer diameter 9.22 mm. Its inner diameter was enlarged to 8 {\bf $\pm ?$} mm to reduce the syringe pressure and enable manual deposition of the very high viscosity liquid. In order to ensure reproducible deposition of the fluid, we placed the syringe inside a tightly-fitting removable holder, which is shown in figure \ref{fig:experimental_apparatus}. The holder consisted of  a Perspex plate with a centred hole, onto which a Perpsex tube of inner diameter equal to that of the hole (and to the outer diameter of the syringe) was mounted perpendicularly, and bonded using Perspex cement.  {\bf I don't really understand your schematic of the syringe holder, in particular the dashed lines.} The holder was mounted on the three vertical, threaded poles, allowing its level to be adjusted in a similar way to the base plate.  Side-view images of the backlit drop were captured with a CCD camera at 20~fps (Pulnix TM-6740CL,  640x480 pixels), which was adjustably wall-mounted. The accurate levelling  of both base plate and syringe holder was essential in order to ensure axisymmetric spreading (see section \ref{expresults}). The working part of the experimental setup was enclosed in a temperature-controlled Perspex cabinet, which temperare was held at $\degCpm{20.3}{0.2}$.

{\bf (You used was a 100W incandescent bulb, and halogen will raise questions about heating, so I don't think you need to be too specific here).}

We performed the spreading experiments with glucose syrup {\bf (manufacturer)}, which is a transparent, highly viscous Newtonian liquid. In order to enhance contrast in the images, the glucose syrup was dyed using red and green food colouring. 
Mixing of the dye entrained air bubbles, which were left to rise out of the fluid overnight. The experiments were performed by filling the syringe with 5 ml of glucose syrup and wiping any excess fluid from the outside of the nozzle with a dry paper towel. The filled syringe was then placed inside the syringe holder, the image acquisition was initiated, and the plunger of the syringe was rapidly displaced manually to empty the syringe barrel.

We measured the density of glucose syrup at the laboratory temperature of $\degCpm{20.3}{0.2}$ to be  $\rho=1372.8 \; \pm \; 4.9 \; \sym{kg}/\sym{m}^3$ by accurately weighing five samples of known volume between 10 and 50~ml.
The viscosity of glucose syrup depends exponentially on temperature \cite{llewellin2002rheology} and we therefore measured it at 20.0, 20.1, 20.3, 20.5 and $\degC{21.0}$ using a Brookfield R/S-Plus (SST) rheometer with a concentric cylinder CC25 geometry and temperature control. We performed shear rate measurements with linear increase from zero to a maximum value of $25 \; \sym{s}^{-1}$ with increments of $1 \; \sym{s}^{-1}$, applying a cycle of incremental shear rate increase and decrease. 
The total experimentation time was 50 s, with one measurement taken every second. Hence, for each temperature we recorded 50 viscosity measurements and these experiments confirmed that the viscosity of glucose syrup is independent of the shear rate and hence behaves as a Newtonian fluid within the parameter range investigated. The resulting averaged values of the dynamic viscosity $\mu$ are presented in table \ref{tab:glucose_viscosity}, showing similar viscosities in the range $20.0 - \degC{20.3}$, but a 7\% decrease at $\degC{21.0}$. The laboratory temperature was recorded for each spreading experiment, so that the viscosity could be adjusted accordingly. The surface tension was taken to be $\sigma=55.0 \pm 0.6$~N/m \cite{montanez2013influence}.

\subsubsection{Substrate preparation}
\label{sec:creating_layer}

For the spreading experiments on a layer of fluid, a thin, uniform layer of glucose syrup had to be deposited in the 2~mm deep trough milled into the substrate plate. The high viscosity of glucose syrup meant that filling the through with the exact amount of fluid to create a layer of known depth, and allowing it to settle, was impractical due to the long timescales involved during which the glucose syrup formed a skin at the surface. Hence, we chose to fill the trough with an excess amount of syrup and scrape across the trough with a square-edged ruler, which resulted in a fluid  layer, which was  uniform to within {\bf $\pm ?\%$}.
 
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/axisym_drop_nozzle_gap.eps}
\caption{Schematic diagram of the underfilled trough.}
\label{fig:axisym_drop_nozzle_gap}
\end{figure}
 
However, the high viscosity of the material meant that a measurable layer of fluid adhered to the scraper, leading to an excess of fluid removed during the scraping process, and hence an underfilled trough with a gap height $\delta^*$ between the top surface of the layer and the platform edge, as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:axisym_drop_nozzle_gap}. Consequently, the actual thickness of the layer, $h^*$, was smaller than the depth of the trough, so that the line of contact between the syrup drop and layer was not visible in the acquired images. This meant that the measured radius $R$ of the spreading drop is the radius at the level of the platform edge, rather than the line of contact with the substrate fluid layer. The value of $\delta^*$ was estimated before each experiment by placing a ruler across the underfilled trough to visualise the height of the gap and capturing an image at a suitable known angle.
The gap size was estimated from the image using the appropriate perspective correction. A sample of two experiments with similar heights is shown in table \ref{tab:gap_sizes}.

 \end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Image analysis}
\label{image}

We analysed the acquired images using \textit{OpenCV} \cite{bradski2008learning} within a \textit{python} environment. 
In order to convert the results from the image analysis into dimensional quantities, a calibration image of a cylindrical object, with known height $H^*=10.08$ mm and diameter $D^*=37.32$ mm, was recorded prior to each experiment. We placed the object in the centre of the trough so that its effective height was reduced to $H^*_{\sym{eff}}=8.08$ mm.
Unavoidable small misalignment of the camera was corrected for in post-processing by rotating the image prior to the analysis, so that the platform edge was perfectly parallel to the image edge. For this purpose we determined the position of the platform edge on the left and right ends of the image by sampling the intensities of the grey scale image along a vertical line from top to bottom, resulting in an intensity profile with a smooth step change at the platform edge. We fitted a hyperbolic tangent function to the intensity profile in order to enhance resolution to sub-pixel accuracy. The difference between the platform position on the left and right gave an estimate of the image rotation. The same edge-finding procedure was applied to determine the diameter $D^*$  and height $H^*_{\sym{eff}}$ of the reference object  in pixels by locating its left and right  edges, and upper edge, respectively. 
The average scaling factor for both horizontal and vertical distances was found to be $0.111 \pm 0.006$ mm/pixel.
We stored this scaling and the image rotation in a file, which we used during the image analysis of the experimental image sequences. 

We recorded the spreading of a sessile drop of glucose syrup on a layer of the same fluid as a sequence of images, capturing the behaviour from the initial deposition until the drop had reached a quasi-equilibrium configuration. 
However, only part of this sequence was analysed. We used a slight motion of the syringe nozzle during deposition to determine the first image after the nozzle came to rest as the initial frame.
We chose the final frame to include a duration of 15 s of spreading, which corresponded to the instant before drop pinch-off, after which the interface became difficult to track because of reflections at the surface. Numerical results shown in Figure \ref{fig:radius_vs_time_influence_pinch_off} demonstrate that the spreading of the droplet is unaffected by the topology near the nozzle, regardless of whether the drop was attached or pinched off. We detected the position of the platform edge, the outside diameter of the syringe nozzle and the positions of its left and right edges from the first image of the sequence, with the same edge-finding procedure described above. However, the intensity profile ceases to feature a smooth step change as the drop spread because of  increased reflections on the fluid surface. Hence, in this limit the smooth intensity profile was fitted with a spline, instead of a hyperbolic tangent function. The edge was detected with sub-pixel accuracy by detecting the point of maximum gradient along the spline. 
We chose the outside diameter of the syringe nozzle as the reference length scale, which we found equal to 9.22 mm from using both calipers and image analysis. {\bf (I do not understand why you need another calibration of your image, given the detailed discussion above.)}

\end{figure}

The results of the image analysis, superimposed on the original droplet image, are shown in Figure \ref{fig:analysis_glucose}. The centreline of the nozzle, the platform and nozzle edges, the drop diameter and the free surface are shown with cyan, orange, green and red lines, respectively.  The location of the fluid interface was detected to the left and right of the centreline of the nozzle.
In the late stages of drop spreading, the edge of the interface became increasingly noisy so that the routine failed to detect the free surface location accurately. The robustness of the analysis was further improved by using the interface position detected in the previous frame of the sequence as an initial condition. Hence, for all images following the initial frame we applied the edge finding routine to a region of $\pm$ 5 pixels horizontally and $\pm$ 2 pixels vertically of the interface position located in the preceding frame. We documented the coordinates of the fluid interface separately for the left and right sides,  relative to the point of intersection of the nozzle centreline and the platform edge. {(\bf Should you not comment on how axisymmetric the drops are here?)}
The measurement errors in the radii of the drop and position of the free surface was the distance to the furthest pixel boundary, in the case of sub-pixel resolution, or one pixel if the determined position was on a pixel boundary. {\bf (I do not understand this last sentence.)}

A sequence of experimental snapshots showing the spreading of a drop of glucose syrup on a layer of the same fluid is shown in figure \ref{fig:glucose_spreading} -- rotated and cropped  images on the left (a, c, e, g), and analysed images on the right (b, d, f, h). Only the drop diameter and free surface shape change with time. The free surface profiles extracted from the images in figure \ref{fig:glucose_spreading} are shown in a single plot in figure \ref{fig:glucose_thick_layer_8_fs_dim}. 
The initial shape is not perfectly symmetric about the centre line, with a 2 \% larger drop radius on the right than on the left. This magnitude of discrepancy is typical for all the experiments reported, and is due to either small imperfections in the deposition process or in the leveling of the platform, as discussed in section \ref{setup}. Moreover, volume is not conserved in the drop outlines shown in figure \ref{fig:glucose_thick_layer_8_fs_dim}, because fluid spreads below the visible platform edge, as shown schematically in figure \ref{fig:axisym_drop_nozzle_gap}. The drop shape changes significantly within the first 7.5~s, but only slightly during the following 7.5~s.

\label{fig:diam_vs_time_comp_layer_dry}
\end{figure}

The diameter evolution averaged across two experiments is shown in figure \ref{fig:diam_vs_time_comp_layer_dry} on a log-log scale, where the error bars of up to 1 \% of the diameter values have been omitted for clarity. The spreading is initially slow but accelerates progressively up to $t\simeq 2$~s to reach a power law dependence $D \propto t^n$ with a scaling exponent of $n=1/5$ at large times. Given the large size of our drop, we expect capillary effects to be negligible and the spreading of our `gravity current' to be governed by a balance between gravity and bulk dissipation. However, our experimental exponent differs from the $n=1/8$ exponent  obtained for an axisymmetric gravity current {\bf [cite Huppert1982, Lopez et al 1976, and check results]}, although it coincides (fortuitously) with that predicted for a droplet spreading in two dimensions under the same mechanism \cite{bonn2009wetting} {\bf [More detail needed about this result, not sure how relevant it is]}. We show in section \ref{?} that the discrepancy with the classical axisymmetric result is related to the thickness of the film on the substrate, which enables fluid displacement through the substrate layer, which enhances the rate of spreading. 

The balance between gravity and bulk dissipation can be estimated with the Galileo number $\displaystyle \sym{Ga} = \frac{g \; \mathcal{L}^3}{\nu^2} = \frac{g \; \rho^2 \; \mathcal{L}^3}{\mu^2}$, where $g$=9.81 m/s$^2$ is the gravitational acceleration and $\mathcal{L}$ a characteristic length scale, which we choose as th e outer nozzle radius, $\mathcal{L}=4.61$~mm.  We obtain 
$\sym{Ga}=9.52 \times 10^{-4}$, which points to a viscously-dominated flow.

\subsubsection{Spreading on a solid substrate}

The diameter evolution averaged across three experiments for spreading experiments performed on a dry, flat substrate is shown in figure \ref{fig:diam_vs_time_comp_layer_dry} on a log-log scale, where the error bars of less than 0.5 \% of the diameter values have been omitted for clarity. The early time spreading rate is similar to that on a liquid layer. However, for $t > 2$~s the spreading rates diverge, with the drop on the solid substrate adopting a spreading law $D \propto t^{1/10}$, corresponding to a considerably slower rate than the drop on the fluid layer. This result is in agreement with the theoretical spreading law for a sessile drop spreading in three dimensions, driven by surface tension and opposed by dissipation at the contact line \cite{bonn2009wetting, cazabat1986dynamics}.
This balance can be quantified with a Capillary number $\displaystyle \sym{Ca} = \frac{\mathcal{U} \; \mu}{\sigma}$,  where $\mathcal{U}=\partial D/ \partial t=0.38 \; \sym{mm/s}$  is the contact line speed, which yields $Ca=0.3$ in our experiments.

%Another relevant non-dimensional number is the Bond number, which expresses the balance between gravitational forces and surface tension.
%The Bond number is defined as
%
%\begin{equation}
% \sym{Bo} = \frac{\mathcal{L}^2 \: g \: \Delta \rho}{\sigma},
%\end{equation}
%where $\Delta \rho = (\rho_{\sym{glucose}} - \rho_{\sym{air}})$ is the density difference between the glucose syrup and the surrounding air.
%We make the assumption $\Delta \rho = \rho_{\sym{glucose}}$, because $\rho_{\sym{air}} \ll \rho_{\sym{glucose}}$.
%Substituting for the material properties and reference length yields $\sym{Bo}=5.2$, indicating that the spreading is relatively unaffected by surface tension and instead gravity is more dominant.

\section{Computations}

\subsection{Computational model}

\subsubsection{Governing equations}

We modelled the spreading of a sessile drop of Newtonian glucose syrup spreading on a layer of the same fluid as a flow which is governed by the dimensional, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations,

\begin{equation}
 \rho \Bigg( \pder[\vect{u}^*]{t^*} + (\vect{u}^* \cdot \nabla^*) \vect{u}^* \Bigg) = \rho \vect{G}^* - \nabla^* p^* + \mu \nabla^{*2} \vect{u}^*,
 \label{eqn:ns_eqn_momentum}
\end{equation}
and

\begin{equation}
 \nabla^* \cdot \vect{u}^* = 0,
 \label{eqn:ns_eqn_continuity}
\end{equation}
where $\vect{u}^*$ is the flow velocity vector, $\rho$ the fluid density and $p^*$ the pressure field in the fluid. 
The gravitational body force, per unit volume, is expressed in the vector $\rho \vect{G}^*$. 

We non-dimensionalised equations (\ref{eqn:ns_eqn_momentum}) and (\ref{eqn:ns_eqn_continuity}) using a characteristic length scale, $\mathcal{L}$, reference velocity, $\mathcal{U}$, and reference time, $\mathcal{T}$. 
The gravitational forces are scaled on the gravitational acceleration $g$. 
Hence,

\begin{gather}
 \vect{u}^*=\mathcal{U} \vect{u}, \qquad \vect{x}^*=\mathcal{L} \vect{x}, \qquad t^*= \mathcal{T} t, \qquad \vect{G}^*=g \vect{G}, \qquad p^*= \frac{\mathcal{U} \mu}{\mathcal{L}} p,
 \label{eqn:ns_eqn_nondim}
\end{gather}
where the pressure and the gravitational body force have been non-dimensionalised on the viscous scale.
The non-dimensional, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are then given by

\begin{equation}
 \sym{Re} \Bigg( \sym{St} \pder[\vect{u}]{t} + (\vect{u} \cdot \nabla) \vect{u} \Bigg) = - \nabla p + \frac{\sym{Re}}{\sym{Fr}} \: \vect{G} + \nabla^2 \vect{u},
 \label{eqn:ns_eqn_momentum_nondim}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
 \nabla \cdot \vect{u} = 0,
 \label{eqn:ns_eqn_continuity_nondim}
\end{equation}
with the dimensionless parameters

\begin{align*}
 \text{Reynolds number:} \qquad &\sym{Re}=\frac{\mathcal{UL} \rho}{\mu}, \\
 \text{Strouhal number:} \qquad &\sym{St}=\frac{\mathcal{L}}{\mathcal{UT}}, \\

Equations (\ref{eqn:ns_eqn_momentum_nondim}) and (\ref{eqn:ns_eqn_continuity_nondim}) are used to determine the pressure and velocity field within a certain domain $\mathcal{D}$. 
In order to obtain these fields, the equations have to be augmented by boundary conditions along at least part of the domain boundary $\partial \mathcal{D}$.

\caption{Schematic diagram of a model in cylindrical polar coordinates of the experiment investigating the spreading of a drop on a layer of the same fluid, where $R_{\sym{contact}}(t)=r(t,z=0)$ is the experimentally visible drop radius.}
\label{fig:axisym_drop_nozzle}
\end{figure}

A schematic diagram of the flow domain and the domain boundaries is shown in figure \ref{fig:axisym_drop_nozzle}.
In the experiments the glucose syrup is deposited using a syringe with a widened nozzle outlet.
The residual fluid in this outlet, following deposition, is included in the numerical model, as shown in figure \ref{fig:axisym_drop_nozzle}, where the top boundary represents the plunger of the syringe and the side boundary is the inner radius of the outlet.
The nozzle is $L^*_{\sym{outlet}}=10$ mm long and the inner radius is determined from the highest point on the free surface.
We solved the equations in cylindrical polar coordinates, with the assumption that there is no variation in the azimuthal direction ($\partial / \partial \phi = 0$), so that it becomes an axisymmetric flow problem in the two spatial dimensions $\vect{x}=\{r,z\}$. 
Moreover, we assumed that there is no swirl, $u_{\phi}=0$, so that the velocity field is $\vect{u}=\{u_r,u_z\}$.
Also, the gravitational acceleration is only acting in the axial direction, $G_z = -1$ and $G_i=0, i = \{ r,\phi \}$.
As shown in figure \ref{fig:axisym_drop_nozzle}, we model the bottom and outer wall of the trough, and the top and outer wall of the nozzle as solid walls.
On these boundaries we apply Dirichlet boundary conditions by prescribing the velocity such that the fluid neither penetrates the wall nor 'slips' along it. 
This 'no slip' boundary condition is expressed as

\begin{equation}
 \vect{u}^* = \pder[\vect{R}_{\sym{wall}}^*]{t^*},
 \label{eqn:ns_eqn_solid_wall_bc}
\end{equation}
where $\vect{R}_{\sym{wall}}^*$ is the Lagrangian position of the respective solid boundary. 
All of the solid boundaries in our model remain stationary and hence $\partial \vect{R}_{\sym{wall}}^*/ \partial t^* = 0$.
Therefore, this boundary condition reduces to

\begin{equation}
 \vect{u} = 0,
 \label{eqn:ns_eqn_solid_wall_bc_non_dim}
\end{equation}
in non-dimensional form.

We modelled the centre line of the drop, at $r=0$, as symmetry boundary on which the velocity normal to the boundary and the traction tangential to the boundary is zero. 
These two conditions are mathematically expressed as

\begin{equation}
 \vect{u}^* \cdot \vect{n}_{\sym{sym}} = 0,
\end{equation}
and

\begin{equation}
 \vect{t}^* \cdot \vect{m}_{\sym{sym}} = 0,
\end{equation}
respectively, where $\vect{n}_{\sym{sym}}$ is the unit normal and $\vect{m}_{\sym{sym}}$ is the unit vector tangent to the symmetry line.
The traction on the boundary, which is equivalent to a Neumann boundary condition, is expressed as

\begin{equation}
 \vect{t}^* = \vect{\sigma}^* \cdot \vect{n}_{\sym{sym}}.
 \label{eqn:ns_eqn_solid_wall_traction_bc}
\end{equation}
In the two-dimensional coordinate space $(r,z)$ the normal and tangent to the symmetry boundary are given by $\vect{n}_{\sym{sym}}= (1 \; 0)$ and $\vect{m}_{\sym{sym}} = (0 \; 1)$.
Hence, the two boundary conditions in non-dimensional form become

\begin{equation}
 u_r = 0,
 \label{eqn:ns_eqn_sym_bc_non_dim}
\end{equation}
and

\begin{equation}
 t_z = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \pder[u_z]{r} = 0.
\end{equation}

At the interface between the glucose syrup and the surrounding atmosphere, as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:axisym_drop_nozzle}, two boundary conditions need to be applied. 
Firstly, at the free surface the traction is not imposed implicitly, but arises from the dynamic boundary condition, which ensures the balance of forces at the free surface. 
Secondly, the kinematic condition links the motion of the fluid interface to the fluid velocities at the interface.


The dynamic boundary condition ensures that the stress is continuous across the interface between two immiscible fluids. 
Now, the traction exerted by fluid 1 onto fluid 2, $\vect{t}^{[1]*}$, is equal but with opposite orientation to the traction exerted by fluid 2 onto fluid 1, $\vect{t}^{[2]*}$ and hence, $\vect{t}^{[1]*} = - \vect{t}^{[2]*}$. 
The traction at the interface in fluid $\beta$ ($\beta=1,2$) is given by

\begin{equation}
 \vect{t}^{[\beta]*} = \vect{\sigma}^{[\beta]*} \cdot \vect{n}^{[\beta]},
\end{equation}
where $\vect{\sigma}^{[\beta]*}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor in fluid $\beta$ and $\vect{n}^{[\beta]}$ is the outer unit normal to fluid $\beta$, pointing out of the fluid. 
Following the definition of the interface normals, $\vect{n}^{[2]} = - \vect{n}^{[1]}$ and hence,

\begin{equation}
 \vect{\sigma}^{[1]*} \cdot \vect{n}^{[1]} = \vect{\sigma}^{[2]*} \cdot \vect{n}^{[1]},
\end{equation}
where we arbitrarily chose the outer unit normal to fluid 1, $\vect{n}^{[1]}$, as the unit normal.


If the interface is curved, surface tension creates a pressure jump across the interface. 
The pressure jump is given by $\Delta p^* = \sigma \kappa^*$, where $\sigma$ is the (constant) surface tension and $\kappa^*$ is twice the mean curvature of the interface and can be calculated from the unit normal to the interface through

\begin{equation}
 \kappa^* = - \nabla_S^* \cdot \vect{n}^{[1]},
\end{equation}
where $\nabla_S^*$ is the surface gradient. 
For the dynamic boundary condition follows

\begin{equation}
 \vect{\sigma}^{[1]*} \cdot \vect{n}^{[1]} = \vect{\sigma}^{[2]*} \cdot \vect{n}^{[1]} + \sigma \kappa^* \vect{n}^{[1]},
\end{equation}
where $\kappa^* < 0$ if the centre of curvature lies inside fluid 1.
Using the reference quantities from (\ref{eqn:ns_eqn_nondim})

\begin{equation}
 \vect{\sigma}^*= \frac{\mathcal{U} \mu_{\sym{ref}}}{\mathcal{L}} \vect{\sigma} \qquad \text{and} \qquad \kappa^*= \frac{1}{\mathcal{L}} \kappa,
\end{equation}
the non-dimensional form of the dynamic boundary condition is given by

\begin{equation}
 \vect{\sigma}^{[1]} \cdot \vect{n}^{[1]} = \vect{\sigma}^{[2]} \cdot \vect{n}^{[1]} + \frac{1}{\sym{Ca}} \kappa \vect{n}^{[1]},
\end{equation}
where the Capillary number is defined as

\begin{equation}
 \sym{Ca} = \frac{\mathcal{U} \mu}{\sigma}.
\end{equation}
We assume that fluid 2 is an inviscid gas so that its stress tensor reduces to $\vect{\sigma}^{[2]}=-p_{\sym{ext}} \: \vect{I}$, where $p_{\sym{ext}}$ is the (non-dimensional) constant pressure above the free surface. 
In this case the non-dimensional dynamic boundary condition becomes

\begin{equation}
 \vect{\sigma} \cdot \vect{n} = \frac{1}{\sym{Ca}} \kappa \vect{n} - p_{\sym{ext}} \vect{n},
 \label{eqn:ns_eqn_dynamic_fs_bc_non_dim}
\end{equation}
where the explicit references to fluid 1 have been dropped, as it is understood that in this specific case the stress tensor and unit normal refer to the single viscous fluid present in the problem.

The kinematic condition ensures that the fluid particles at the free surface remain there at all times. 
If the free surface is parametrised by the intrinsic coordinates $\vect{\zeta}^*$, then the Eulerian position of the free surface at any given time is written as $\vect{R}_{\sym{fs}}^*=\vect{R}_{\sym{fs}}^*(\vect{\zeta}^*,t^*)$.
The kinematic condition is then given by

\begin{equation}
 \Bigg( \vect{u}^* - \pder[\vect{R}_{\sym{fs}}^*]{t^*} \Bigg) \cdot \vect{n} = 0,
\end{equation}
where $\vect{n}$ is the outer unit normal to the free surface, pointing out of the fluid. 
Using the problem-specific quantities from (\ref{eqn:ns_eqn_nondim}) and using the non-dimensionalisations

\begin{equation}
 \vect{u}^* = \mathcal{U} \vect{u}, \qquad \vect{R}_{\sym{fs}}^* = \mathcal{L} \vect{R}_{\sym{fs}} \qquad \text{and} \qquad t^*=\mathcal{T} t,
\end{equation}
the non-dimensional form of the kinematic boundary condition becomes

\begin{equation}
 \Bigg( \vect{u} - \sym{St} \: \pder[\vect{R}_{\sym{fs}}]{t} \Bigg) \cdot \vect{n} = 0.
 \label{eqn:ns_eqn_kinematic_fs_bc_non_dim}
\end{equation}



In order to validate the computations against the experimentally observed flow, we numerically modelled the single spreading experiment on a layer as presented in section \ref{sec:expt_spreading_on_layer}.
The second experiment for the spreading on a layer is qualitatively similar and is therefore not specifically discussed here.
The initial shape of the free surface in the computation is constructed based on the free surface location determined during the experimental analysis.
However, the computation is limited to one side of the free surface, because axisymmetric flow is assumed and we arbitrarily chose the right-hand surface of the drop.
As discussed in section \ref{sec:creating_layer} we found experimentally that there is a gap $\delta^*$ between the fluid layer and platform edge which means that part of the drop surface is invisible in the experiment, as indicated in figure \ref{fig:axisym_drop_nozzle}.
The size of this gap was difficult to determine accurately and was therefore estimated at $\delta^*=1.15$ mm, resulting in an estimated uniform fluid layer thickness of $h^*=0.85$ mm.
However, through numerical experiments we found that the actual layer thickness was $h^*=1.25$ mm and the results for the estimated and computationally re-constructed layer thickness are compared in section \ref{sec:comp_spreading_on_layer}.
For the flow simulation we re-constructed the experimentally invisible part of the free surface by fitting a spline through the points on the uniform fluid layer and the visible part of the surface.
The quantity $R_{\sym{contact}}^*$ in figure \ref{fig:axisym_drop_nozzle} represents the outermost experimentally visible drop radius at the level of the platform edge, which in the model is located at $z=0$, as indicated in the schematic diagram.

\subsubsection{Non-dimensional parameters}

We chose the outer radius of the nozzle outlet $R_{\sym{outlet}}^*$ as shown in figure \ref{fig:axisym_drop_nozzle} as characteristic length scale, $\mathcal{L}$, in this problem.
As the characteristic velocity scale of the problem we chose the settling velocity of a sessile drop under gravity, so that

\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{U}=\frac{\rho g \mathcal{L}^2}{\mu},
 \label{eqn:vel_scale}
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ and $\rho$ are the glucose viscosity and density, respectively, which we determined experimentally.
We chose the intrinsic timescale as the reference timescale for the setup,

\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{T} = \frac{\mathcal{L}}{\mathcal{U}} = \frac{\mu}{\rho g \mathcal{L}},
 \label{eqn:time_scale}
\end{equation}
resulting in a unit Strouhal number.
In summary, the non-dimensional parameters that enter the Navier-Stokes equations directly are given by

\begin{gather}
 \sym{Re} = \frac{\rho \mathcal{U L}}{\mu} = \frac{\rho^2 \; g \; R_{\sym{outlet}}^{*3}}{\mu^2}, \qquad \sym{St} = \frac{\mathcal{L}}{\mathcal{U} \mathcal{T}} = 1, \qquad \sym{Fr} = \frac{\mathcal{U}^2}{g \; \mathcal{L}} = \frac{\rho^2 \; g \; R_{\sym{outlet}}^{*3}}{\mu^2} = \sym{Re}, \nonumber \\[0.75cm]
 \sym{Ca} = \frac{\mu \mathcal{U}}{\sigma} = \frac{\rho g R_{\sym{outlet}}^{*2}}{\sigma}.
 \label{eqn:nondim_numbers}
\end{gather}
For this choice of non-dimensionalisation, $\sym{Ca}$ is independent of the viscosity and $\sym{Fr}=\sym{Re}$, so that $\sym{Re}/\sym{Fr} = 1$.
We non-dimensionalised the geometric parameters on the reference length scale of the problem such that

\begin{equation}
 h = \frac{h^*}{R_{\sym{outlet}}^*}, \qquad \delta = \frac{\delta^*}{R_{\sym{outlet}}^*}, \qquad R_{\sym{outer}} = \frac{R_{\sym{outer}}^*}{R_{\sym{outlet}}^*}, \qquad L_{\sym{outlet}} = \frac{L_{\sym{outlet}}^*}{R_{\sym{outlet}}^*},
\end{equation}
where $R_{\sym{outer}}^*$ the radius of the trough.
The values of the non-dimensional numbers are

\begin{equation}
 \sym{Re} = \sym{Fr} = 9.523 \times 10^{-4}, \qquad \sym{St}=1, \qquad \sym{Ca}=5.204,
\end{equation}
and the geometric values are

\begin{equation}
 h = 0.184, \qquad \delta=0.249, \qquad R_{\sym{outer}}=6.562, \qquad L_{\sym{outlet}}=2.169.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Discretisation in FEM}

We discretised the fluid domain and the domain boundary using the finite element method (FEM) as implemented in \texttt{oomph-lib} \cite{HeilHazelOomph2006}.
Flow problems involving free surfaces are conveniently represented using unstructured meshes with triangular elements, because it is challenging to represent complex interface shapes using structured meshes with a set of rectangular elements.
Therefore, we used triangular elements in an axisymmetric coordinate systems and we generated the unstructured meshes using \texttt{Triangle} \cite{shewchuk96b}.
Specifically, we used six-noded, triangular Taylor-Hood \cite{taylor1973numerical} elements ($P_2 P_1$) with a maximum element area of 0.05.
The Taylor-Hood elements satisfy the Lady\u{z}enskaja-Babu\u{s}ka-Brezzi (LBB) condition \cite{sani2000incompressible}, which means that they do not feature any spurious pressure modes.
Moreover, the solution obtained with these elements is guaranteed to converge at the optimal, quadratic convergence rate under mesh refinement \cite{donea2003finite}.
In the free-surface problem that we modelled, the domain is moving and it is discretised using an unstructured mesh which is fitted to the fluid domain. 
Hence, the mesh is deforming in response to the motion of the fluid, which we realised by using the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) method \cite{donea1982arbitrary}.
Specifically, the change of the mesh shape is driven by the motion of the free surface.
Additional unknowns are introduced, because the location of the free surface $\vect{R}_{\sym{fs}}$ is unknown and has to be determined during the solution process.
The additional equations that need to be solved to obtain $\vect{R}_{\sym{fs}}$ arise from the kinematic boundary condition.
At every timestep the location of the free surface is determined and the positions of the nodes in the mesh are updated accordingly employing a pseudo-solid mesh approach.
The pseudo-solid node-update procedure treats the mesh as an elastic body, which deforms, and at every timestep a solid mechanics problem needs to be solved simultaneously with the fluids problem to compute the unknown nodal positions.
The position of the free surface is imposed by artificial pressures acting normal to the interface, which have the function of Lagrange multipliers and are obtained through the solution of the kinematic boundary condition.
Although this approach is computationally expensive as it introduces two additional unknowns at each node and a solid mechanics problem has to be solved at each timestep, it enables the simulation of flows with complex free surface shapes, which is required for our problem.
In the process of timestepping, the elements in the mesh become increasingly distorted, because the node positions are constantly updated.
Therefore we re-generated the mesh after every two time steps based on the current position of the domain boundaries and the current solution is projected across onto the new mesh.
We performed time-dependent simulations and used a second-order accurate Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF2) scheme \cite{sani2000incompressible} for the temporal discretisation.
In order to enable direct comparison with the experiment, the flow was simulated for the duration of the experiment, $t^*_{\sym{exp}}=15$ s.
The time step in the temporal discretisation was chosen as the time difference between successive frames in the experiment, $\Delta t^*_{\sym{exp}} = 0.05$ s.
We performed mesh independence studies, which showed that the chosen spatial and temporal discretisation accurately resolve the problem.
At every time step we recorded the shape of the free surface and the radius $R_{\sym{contact}}(t)=r(t,z=0)$.

\caption{Free surface at different times for a layer thickness of $h^*=1.25$ mm compared against the experiment. Points represent the free surface shape in the experiment; lines represent the computed free surface. Inset shows different measurement points for the drop radius.}
\label{fig:glucose_thick_layer_8_fs_dim_gap_0.75mm}
\end{figure}

The computed shape of the free surface of the spreading drop, $\vect{R}^*_{\sym{fs}}(t)$, at different dimensional times $t^*$ is compared against the experimentally determined shape in figure \ref{fig:glucose_thick_layer_8_fs_dim_gap_0.75mm}, where the error bars represent the pixelation error of the image analysis.
There is excellent agreement between the computations and experiment and the computations provide additional insight into the profile for $z<0$.
As the drop spreads out its height reduces and the fluid thread between the bulk of the drop and the residual fluid in the nozzle outlet narrows.
The radius of this thread decreases, resulting eventually in pinch-off due to the Plateau-Rayleigh instability.
However, the computation was stopped before the pinch-off.
Moreover, there is a significant change of the free surface shape in the region between the drop and the fluid layer.
Initially, the curvature in this region is high, but as the drop spreads the interface is pushed out and the curvature decreases until the free surface forms a wedge which advances.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/radius_vs_time_measure_pos_dim.eps}
\caption{Temporal evolution of the drop radius at different measurement points on a log-log scale.}
\label{fig:glucose_thick_layer_8_radius_vs_time_non_dim}
\end{figure}

The evolution of the drop radius is shown in figure \ref{fig:glucose_thick_layer_8_radius_vs_time_non_dim} on a log-log scale at different measurement points.
The radius is determined at the level of the platform edge, as in the experiment, and at the points where the gap is 5\% and 10\% filled (see figure \ref{fig:glucose_thick_layer_8_fs_dim_gap_0.75mm}).
The radius evolution at $z=0$ is not plotted over the entire range, because at larger times the drop height decreases to $H^* < 0$ and hence no radius at $z=0$ can be determined.
Also shown in figure \ref{fig:glucose_thick_layer_8_radius_vs_time_non_dim} is the spreading law of $n$=1/5, which applies to the radius evolution at $z=0$, but for the other two measurement points the spreading law differs.
The drop spreading based on the radius determined at a 5\% and 10\% filled gap, respectively, is similar and the spreading law is identical for $t^*>20$ s.
The spreading based on the radius at $z=0$ is significantly different and does not represent the actual dynamics.

\label{fig:glucose_thick_layer_8_radius_vs_time_vary_layer}
\end{figure}

The radius evolution from the experiments at $z=0$ is compared against the computed one in figure \ref{fig:glucose_thick_layer_8_radius_vs_time_vary_layer}, for both the experimentally estimated layer thickness of $h^*=0.85$ mm and the computationally re-constructed layer thickness of $h^*=1.25$ mm, which we determined to fit the experimental radius evolution.
This figure indicates that the layer thickness has strong influence on the drop spreading, which motivated further numerical experiments.

 \caption{Illustration of different spreading regimes for different layer thicknesses. The contours represent the magnitude of the velocity $|u|=\sqrt{u_r^2+u_z^2}$ and the streamlines illustrate the velocity field.}
 \label{tab:spreading_regimes}
\end{table}

The same drop spreading on significantly varying layer thicknesses is illustrated in the sequences in table \ref{tab:spreading_regimes}.
The contours show the magnitude of the flow velocity and the black lines are representative stream lines.
The rate of spreading as well as the shape of the drop as it spreads vary significantly depending on the layer thickness.
For a comparatively thick film of $h^*=12.5$ mm the stream lines indicate that the drop sinks in. 
The flow is predominantly in the layer, which at $t=2$ results in a bulge of the free surface ahead of the actual drop contact.
With decreasing layer thickness there is less flow in the layer and the drop is spreading instead of sinking in.
However, the spreading mechanism for a layer thickness of 1.25 mm and 0.0125 mm differs as illustrated in table \ref{tab:spreading_regimes}.
In case of a layer thickness of 1.25 mm the drop spreads by fluid flowing into the layer and pushing the free surface upwards in the contact region, as shown by the stream lines.
This leads to the formation of a wedge, which constantly advances and is sustained by the flow into the layer ahead.
For a layer thickness of one hundreth of this value, the fluid no longer flows ahead into the layer and pushes the interface up.
Instead, the drop spreads through flow into the contact region which pushes the interface radially outward. \\

\label{fig:radius_vs_time_before_and_after_pinch_off}
\end{figure}

The radius evolution for varying layer thicknesses down to less than one hundreth of the experimental value is shown in figure \ref{fig:radius_vs_time_before_and_after_pinch_off}.
The results indicate a transition from one spreading regime to another as the layer thickness decreases.
In the first regime, covering a layer thickness $h^*$ from 1.25 to 0.5 mm, the onset of spreading is at around $t=0.3$.
This onset is followed by surface tension dominated spreading, indicated by spreading laws of around $R \propto t^{1/10}$.
This spreading mode is followed by viscous dominated spreading with spreading laws of around $R \propto t^{1/5}$.
The duration of the initial surface tension spreading reduces with layer thickness and eventually vanishes for $h^*=0.125$ mm.
In the second regime, covering a layer thickness $h^*$ from 0.125 to 0.005 mm, the onset of spreading is at around $t=3.0$ and hence noticably delayed compared to the first regime.
Also, spreading laws in this regime close to $R \propto t^{1/8}$ indicate that the entire spreading following onset in the second regime is dominated by gravity \cite{cazabat1986dynamics}. \\


In the simulations the liquid thread between the drop and the nozzle is getting thinner, and this geometric restriction limits the extent of the computational results.
In order to cover the temporal range in figure \ref{fig:radius_vs_time_before_and_after_pinch_off} we manually cut this thread and restarted the simulations.
This step can be performed because Re $\ll$ 1 and inertial effects are negligible.

\caption{Influence of manual for $h^*=1.25$ mm.}

\end{figure}

To assess the influence of when we disconnect the drop from the nozzle we performed simulations where we cut the thread once its radius reached a value of $r_{\sym{thread}}=0.1$ and 0.01, respectively.
The results are shown in figure \ref{fig:radius_vs_time_influence_pinch_off}, where the radius evolution for the two cases is compared againt the results without pinch off.
There is excellent agreement in all cases, so therefore we arbitrarily chose to disconnect at a thread radius of 0.1 and continue the simulations. \\

From figure \ref{fig:radius_vs_time_before_and_after_pinch_off} we extracted radius scaling laws for both the short term and long term behaviour.
The different spreading exponents are shown in figure \ref{fig:scaling_vs_layer} as function of the layer thickness.
Only for layer thicknesses of $h^*=1.25$ to 0.5 mm we were able to extract a distinct short term scaling, as discussed previously.
The dashed line indicates a layer thickness of 2.5 mm at which the drop begins to sink into the layer, similarly to the behaviour observed for $h^*=12.5$ mm in table \ref{tab:spreading_regimes}.
The spreading exponents for the long term behaviour in figure \ref{fig:scaling_vs_layer} confirm the existence of two distinct spreading regimes depending on the layer thickness.
Moreover, they suggest a smooth transition between these two regimes.
The short term, surface tension driven spreading evolves with layer thickness similarly to the long term behaviour. \\

Typical shapes of the spreading front in an established steady state propagation, at $t=500$, are shown in table \ref{tab:front_shape}.
For sufficiently thick layers, in this case $h^*=1.25$ mm, there is a smooth transition from the layer to the drop.
As the layer gets thinner the Landau-Levich meniscus \cite{maleki2011landau} begins to form and the thinner the layer the more pronounced it becomes.
However, a direct comparison to Landau and Levich's theory is not possible, because it is derived for a plate that is withdrawn from a fluid bath.
Their controlling parameter was the speed of the plate, equivalent to our spreading velocity here, and their measured quantity was the residual fluid layer on the plate.
However, in our setup we impose the thickness of the layer instead of treating it as an unknown, and hence Landau and Levich's scaling cannot be applied.


\section{Discussion}

Key findings

\begin{itemize}
 \item spreading on layer viscously dominated, spreading on solid surface tension dominated
 \item spreading on layer, exponent dependent on layer thickness
 \item distinct regimes with or without Landau-Levich meniscus
